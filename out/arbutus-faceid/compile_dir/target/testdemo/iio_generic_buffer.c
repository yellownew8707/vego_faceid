 * Reads the current buffer setup from sysfs and starts a short capture

 * conversion.
 *
 * Command line parameters
 * generic_buffer -n <device_name> -t <trigger_name>
 * If trigger name is not specified the program assumes you want a dataready
 * trigger associated with the device and goes looking for it.
